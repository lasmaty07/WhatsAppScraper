# WhatsApp Scraper

Script for getting stickers and images from a whatsapp chat, via whatsappweb. I created this script in order to move all my custom stickers from whatsapp to telegram.

- This will NOT download ALL stickers from a chat, will only download cached stickers. at first instance *WhatsApp Web** just loads 14 stickers from any given chat, but if you scroll you could get all of them (not entirely tested)

## Issues

yeah, a couple. i'm going to cleanup the code. but I don't think i'll fix any issues for the time being. This just worked for me and i'ts enough. 

## Credits

this was mainly based on [this code](https://gist.github.com/DeaVenditama/b39a33f335b51b97a24135f41b55b150#file-scraper-py) from [here](https://deavenditama.medium.com/simple-whatsapp-images-scrapper-d65676348cde)
